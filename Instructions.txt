The "app.py" is a file which can be exposed as a library that supports the basic CRD(create, read, write) operations. 
The file "data.txt" is a data store meant to local storage for one single process on single laptop.
The file "data.txt" stores the JSON objects that we got from the operations performed.
Import the main file "app.py" as library in your file.
Perform the required operations such as Create, Read, Delete and additional operations such as Modify, Display.
Run the "demo.py" file to check the functionality.
Thank You !!
